            <li>The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other. It leaves an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes. It might also spread via contaminated surfaces.</li>
            <li> When cooking and preparing food, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce and fish sauce).</li>
            <li>The great majority of people with coronavirus will have mild or moderate disease and will make a full recovery within 2-4 weeks. But even if you are young and healthy - meaning your risk of severe disease is low - it is not non-existent.</li>
